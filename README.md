Nigerian Traffic Crashes Analysis

Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of traffic crashes across Nigeria using the "Nigerian Traffic Crashes" dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes crash data from 2020 to 2024, and the analysis explores trends, contributing factors, and high-risk states and quarters.

Key Insights

Total Crashes Trend: Fluctuations over time with peaks in Q4 2022 and a decrease in Q3 2023.

High-Risk States: The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) consistently recorded the highest number of crashes.

Correlation Between Injuries and Fatalities: A strong positive correlation (0.87), indicating that more injuries often result in more fatalities.

Contributing Factors: Speed violations, poor weather, fatigue, and other factors were major contributors to crashes.

Methodology

Dataset: "Nigerian Traffic Crashes" from Kaggle.

Tools: Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) for data analysis and visualization.

Analysis: Identified crash trends, correlations, and factors contributing to accidents across states and quarters.

Recommendations


Speed Enforcement: Stricter enforcement in states like Bayelsa with high-speed violation rates.

Emergency Response: Improved medical response and infrastructure in high-risk areas.

Fatigue Management: Implementation of rest stops and fatigue detection systems along highways.

Conclusion
This analysis provides actionable insights into traffic safety in Nigeria, offering data-driven recommendations to reduce crash rates and fatalities.
